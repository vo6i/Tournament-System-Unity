				     # Tutorial: Implementing a Random Tournament System in Unity 3D

## Introduction

Creating a tournament system in Unity 3D can add depth to your game’s mechanics, especially in competitive genres. This tutorial focuses on designing a **Random Tournament** system that randomly selects **opponents** through an **algorithm** for **matchmaking**. We will cover the **setup**, **implementation**, and **code** necessary to create a functional tournament structure.

### Prerequisites

- Basic knowledge of Unity 3D
- Familiarity with C# programming
- Unity 3D installed on your computer

## Step 1: Setting Up Your Project

1. **Create a New Unity Project**: Open Unity Hub and create a new project using the 3D template.
2. **Scene Setup**: In your new scene, create a simple UI to display the tournament results, such as a Canvas with Text elements to show player pairings.

## Step 2: Design the Tournament Structure

### Tournament Logic

1. **Define Players**: Create a class to represent players in the tournament.

```csharp
public class Player
{
    public string Name { get; set; }
    // Additional attributes can be added here
}
```

2. **Tournament Class**: Create a class to manage the tournament.

```csharp
public class Tournament
{
    private List<Player> players;

    public Tournament(List<Player> playerList)
    {
        players = playerList;
    }

    // Function to start the tournament
    public void StartTournament()
    {
        // Call the matchmaking function
        RandomMatchmaking();
    }
}
```

## Step 3: Implementing the Random Opponent Selection Algorithm

### Random Matchmaking Function

1. **Shuffling Logic**: Implement a method to shuffle the players randomly.

```csharp
private void RandomMatchmaking()
{
    Shuffle(players);
    PairPlayers();
}

private void Shuffle(List<Player> playerList)
{
    System.Random rng = new System.Random();
    int n = playerList.Count;

    while (n > 1)
    {
        int k = rng.Next(n--);
        Player value = playerList[n];
        playerList[n] = playerList[k];
        playerList[k] = value;
    }
}
```

2. **Pairing Logic**: Create a function to pair the players for matches.

```csharp
private void PairPlayers()
{
    for (int i = 0; i < players.Count; i += 2)
    {
        if (i + 1 < players.Count)
        {
            Debug.Log($"{players[i].Name} vs {players[i + 1].Name}");
            // Add match logic here
        }
    }
}
```

### Final Tournament Class

Combine the above code snippets into your `Tournament` class:

```csharp
public class Tournament
{
    private List<Player> players;

    public Tournament(List<Player> playerList)
    {
        players = playerList;
    }

    public void StartTournament()
    {
        Shuffle(players);
        PairPlayers();
    }

    private void Shuffle(List<Player> playerList)
    {
        System.Random rng = new System.Random();
        int n = playerList.Count;

        while (n > 1)
        {
            int k = rng.Next(n--);
            Player value = playerList[n];
            playerList[n] = playerList[k];
            playerList[k] = value;
        }
    }

    private void PairPlayers()
    {
        for (int i = 0; i < players.Count; i += 2)
        {
            if (i + 1 < players.Count)
            {
                Debug.Log($"{players[i].Name} vs {players[i + 1].Name}");
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Step 4: Integrating with Unity

1. **Create a Game Manager Script**: Create a script that initializes the tournament when the game starts.

```csharp
public class GameManager : MonoBehaviour
{
    void Start()
    {
        List<Player> playerList = new List<Player>
        {
            new Player { Name = "Player 1" },
            new Player { Name = "Player 2" },
            new Player { Name = "Player 3" },
            new Player { Name = "Player 4" }
        };

        Tournament tournament = new Tournament(playerList);
        tournament.StartTournament();
    }
}
```

2. **Attach the Game Manager Script**: Attach this script to an empty GameObject in your scene.

## Step 5: Testing the Tournament System

1. **Run the Game**: Hit the play button in Unity and observe the console log. You should see random pairings of players for the tournament.

2. **Expand the System**: Consider implementing additional features such as:
   - Bracket structure for multiple rounds.
   - User interface elements to display the tournament progress.
   - Rules for match outcomes and progression.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, you learned how to create a **Random Tournament System** in **Unity 3D**. We implemented an **opponent selection algorithm** that shuffles players and pairs them for matches. This foundational setup can be further expanded with additional features and mechanics to enhance your game’s competitive elements. Happy coding!
